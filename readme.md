# Quantum Ecosystem for Medical Imaging

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for the Quantum Ecosystem for Medical Imaging project. The project aims to leverage quantum computing techniques to enhance medical imaging processes.

## Features
- Implementation of quantum algorithms for image processing.
- Integration with classical machine learning models.
- Automated preprocessing and feature extraction.

## Repository Structure
- `main.py`: Main script to run the application.
- `model.py`: Contains model definitions and training routines.
- `preprocessfunc.py`: Functions for preprocessing medical images.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions used across the project.
- `finalized_model.sav`: Saved model file.
- Data files: `.csv` files containing the dataset.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GauthamPrabhuM/Quantum-Ecosystem-for-Medical-Imaging-.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
